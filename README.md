# ontoreef_moveit_scene_manager
Node to load data coming from a point cloud-based semantic perception system into a MoveIt! planning scene.

More details on the perception system based coming soon. It publishes a list of the primitive shapes detected, their centre of mass estimated on the detected shape and their position.
A link will be added here when the perception module will be published.
Part of my reasoning and execution framework master thesis project. 

More details coming soon...
